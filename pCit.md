# Citizen association


* WellBeing

Citizen associations work in favor of the wellbeing of their neighborhoods by organizing collective activities and advocating for local needs, which fosters a strong sense of community and support among residents. They also serve as a bridge between the community and policymakers, ensuring that the health, safety, and happiness of the neighborhood are prioritized in local decision-making.

# Original text Online tool for exploring occupant behaviours: This online tool categorizes key energy-related behaviours of building occupants. This includes the location of the study, the type of building being scrutinised, and the type of occupant referred to â€“ for example, a particular age group, or occupational group. It offers insights into each building type present in the living labs, and thus offering a database for investigating where occupant behaviours are likely to be most prevalent and targetable for future research in Probono, based on a systematic interrogation of existing research from the past five years.

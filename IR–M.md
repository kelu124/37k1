# Original text Advanced GBN integrated e-mobility systems and application in Madrid LL: ST4.6.2 will provide an e-mobility system. Provide a fully integrated system in the Madrid LL, managing energy for mobility from renewable sources together with the rest of the energy to be used in the buildings, combining different energy sources like Aeolic, photovoltaic and the grid so the whole system will be neutral or positive from an energy point of view. The system will include RESS (rechargeable energy storage systems) properly sized, in collaboration with T4.5, and will integrate the battery of the different vehicles in order to maximize the energy use, through artificial intelligence and V2X (vehicle to everything) communication. CIDAUT will implement various solutions for vehicle charging. Three technologies will be combined depending to the users’ needs: battery swapping, conductive charging, inductive charging

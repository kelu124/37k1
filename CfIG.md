# Original text Digital twin Intelligent GBN subsystems Monitoring Control Connectors : ST5.2.1 Intelligent GBN subsystems Monitoring Control (IMC) Connectors. Define, design, and deploy the infrastructure to connect the GBN platform external systems data sources, including sensors, external databases. Perform technical analysis to identify connection protocols to back-end systems and overall connectivity needs, design and deploy connectivity solutions. IMC Connectors are key enablers allowing interdependence between GBN-DT Subsystems modelled to follow local physical reality on which the DT is based. A central IMC Connectors module will (a) Manage device authentication, end-to-end encryption (b) Streaming and Queuing message exchanges (Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar) (c) Automate deployment (Kubernetes) and cluster configurations for increased message loads and efficiency in processing, (d) Embed monitoring and visualisation via a Management and configuration UI (e.g. Grafana), (e) Integrate CHARIoT blockchain-based PKI for sensor and gateway authentication and blockchain aided encryption of IoT endpoints, (f) CoveR Smart contracts for process automation (certification process, contract process), secure IOT, DT Data transparency and trust.
The connectors will enable connection with other data exchange platforms (such as e-delivery, X-Road, etc.). All APIs developed and deployed in the context of a PROBONO Living Lab will become available via an API Registry that will notably include automated technical documentation and implementation synchronisation

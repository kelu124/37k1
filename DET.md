# Original text Digital Collaborative Engagement Tools: Develop methods and adaptative tools that will be applied in activities in each LL for debating narratives and ideas for the GBN among stakeholders, particularly with citizens from local communities. 
Some of these are: adapted geodesign workshops for each GBN, digital tools which building users / citizens can provide ideas that can be tested for the GB and GBN (Beta Projects); digital tools that break silos, i.e., that improve communication between different groups of stakeholders; digital tools that allow visualisation of the transformative changes in discussion
